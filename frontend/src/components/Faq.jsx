<h3><a class="anchor" name="general-questions" href="#general-questions"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>General Questions</h3>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-what-is-telegram-what-do-i-do-here" href="#q-what-is-telegram-what-do-i-do-here"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: What is Telegram? What do I do here?</h4>
<p>Telegram is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security, it’s super-fast, simple and free. You can use Telegram on all your devices <strong>at the same time</strong> — your messages sync seamlessly across any number of your phones, tablets or computers.</p>
<p>With Telegram, you can send messages, photos, videos and <a href="/blog/shared-files"><strong>files</strong></a> of any type (doc, zip, mp3, etc), as well as create groups for up to <strong>200,000</strong> people or <a href="/blog/channels">channels</a> for broadcasting to <strong>unlimited</strong> audiences. You can write to your phone contacts and find people by their <a href="#usernames-and-t-me"><strong>usernames</strong></a>. As a result, Telegram is like SMS and email combined — and can take care of all your personal or business messaging needs. In addition to this, we support <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/calls">end-to-end encrypted voice calls</a>.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-who-is-telegram-for" href="#q-who-is-telegram-for"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Who is Telegram for?</h4>
<p>Telegram is for everyone who wants fast and reliable messaging and <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/calls">calls</a>. Business users and small teams may like the large groups, <a href="https://telegram.org/faq#usernames-and-t-me">usernames</a>, <a href="https://desktop.telegram.org">desktop apps</a> and powerful <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/shared-files">file sharing</a> options.</p>
<p>Since Telegram groups can have up to <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/replies-mentions-stickers">200,000 members</a>, we support <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/replies-mentions-hashtags">replies, mentions and hashtags</a> that help maintain order and keep communication in large communities <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/replies-mentions-stickers">efficient</a>. You can appoint <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/admin-revolution">admins with advanced tools</a> to help these communities prosper in peace. <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/supergroups5k">Public groups</a> can be joined by anyone and are powerful platforms for discussions and collecting feedback.</p>
<p>In case you&#39;re more into pictures, Telegram has animated <a href="/blog/gif-revolution">gif search</a>, a state of the art <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/photo-editor-and-passcodes">photo editor</a>, and an <a href="/blog/stickers-revolution">open sticker platform</a> (find some cool stickers <a href="https://t.me/durov/40">here</a> or <a href="https://t.me/sticker">here</a>). What‘s more, there is no need to worry about disk space on your device. With Telegram’s cloud support and <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/cache-and-stickers">cache management options</a>, Telegram can take up nearly <strong>zero</strong> space on your phone.</p>
<p>Those looking for extra privacy should check out our <a href="/blog/privacy-revolution">advanced settings</a> and rather revolutionary <a href="/privacy">policy</a>. And if you want secrecy, try our device-specific <a href="#secret-chats">Secret Chats</a> with self-destructing messages, photos, and videos — and lock your app with an additional <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/photo-editor-and-passcodes">passcode</a>.</p>

<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-is-telegram-different-from-whatsapp" href="#q-how-is-telegram-different-from-whatsapp"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How is Telegram different from WhatsApp?</h4>
<p>Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram is a cloud-based messenger with seamless sync. As a result, you can access your messages from several devices at once, including tablets and computers, and share an unlimited number of photos, videos and files (doc, zip, mp3, etc.) of up to 1,5 GB <em>each</em>. And if you don&#39;t want to store all that data on your device, you can always <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/cache-and-stickers">keep it in the cloud</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to our multi-data center infrastructure and encryption, Telegram is faster and way more <a href="#security">secure</a>. On top of that, Telegram is free and will stay free — no ads, no subscription fees, forever.</p>
<p>Our API is open, and we welcome developers to create their own Telegram apps. We also have a <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots">Bot API</a>, a platform for developers that allows anyone to easily build specialized tools for Telegram, <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/inline-bots">integrate any services</a>, and even <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/payments">accept payments</a> from users around the world. </p>
<p>And that‘s just the tip of the iceberg. Don’t forget to check out <a href="#q-who-is-telegram-for">this paragraph</a> for even more exclusive stuff.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-old-is-telegram" href="#q-how-old-is-telegram"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How old is Telegram?</h4>
<p>Telegram for iOS was launched on August 14, 2013. The alpha version of Telegram for Android officially launched on October 20, 2013. More and more <a href="/apps">Telegram clients</a> appear, built by independent developers using Telegram&#39;s <a href="//core.telegram.org/api">open platform</a>.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-which-devices-can-i-use" href="#q-which-devices-can-i-use"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Which devices can I use?</h4>
<p>You can use Telegram on smartphones, tablets, and even computers. We have apps for <a href="https://telegram.org/dl/ios">iOS</a> (9.0 and above), <a href="https://telegram.org/dl/android">Android</a> (4.1 and up) and <a href="https://telegram.org/dl/wp">Windows Phone</a>. You can also use Telegram&#39;s <a href="https://web.telegram.org">web version</a> or install one of our <a href="https://desktop.telegram.org">desktop apps</a> for Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can log in to Telegram from as many of your devices as you like — all <strong>at the same time</strong>. Just use your main mobile phone number to log in everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our <a href="//core.telegram.org/api">API</a> is open for developers, should you want to build your own applications for other platforms.  </p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-who-are-the-people-behind-telegram" href="#q-who-are-the-people-behind-telegram"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Who are the people behind Telegram?</h4>
<p>Telegram is supported by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Durov">Pavel Durov</a> and his brother Nikolai. Pavel supports Telegram financially and ideologically while Nikolai&#39;s input is technological. To make Telegram possible, Nikolai developed a unique custom data protocol, which is open, secure and optimized for work with multiple data-centers. As a result, Telegram combines security, reliability and speed on any network.</p>

<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-where-is-telegram-based" href="#q-where-is-telegram-based"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Where is Telegram based?</h4>
<p>The Telegram development team is based in Dubai.</p>
<p>Most of the developers behind Telegram originally come from St. Petersburg, the city famous for its unprecedented number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest#Winners">highly skilled engineers</a>. The Telegram team had to leave Russia due to local IT regulations and has tried a number of locations as its base, including Berlin, London and Singapore. We’re currently happy with Dubai, although are ready to relocate again if local regulations change.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-will-you-have-ads-or-sell-my-data-or-steal-my-beloved-and-ensl" href="#q-will-you-have-ads-or-sell-my-data-or-steal-my-beloved-and-ensl"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Will you have ads? Or sell my data? Or steal my beloved and enslave my children?</h4>
<p>No.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-are-you-going-to-make-money-out-of-this" href="#q-how-are-you-going-to-make-money-out-of-this"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How are you going to make money out of this?</h4>
<p>We believe in fast and secure messaging that is also 100% free.</p>
<p><a href="/press">Pavel Durov</a>, who shares our vision, supplied Telegram with a generous donation, so we have quite enough money for the time being. If Telegram runs out, we will introduce non-essential paid options to support the infrastructure and finance developer salaries. But making profits will never be an end-goal for Telegram. </p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-what-are-your-thoughts-on-internet-privacy" href="#q-what-are-your-thoughts-on-internet-privacy"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: What are your thoughts on internet privacy?</h4>
<p>Big internet companies like Facebook or Google have effectively hijacked the privacy discourse in the recent years. Their marketers managed to convince the public that the most important things about privacy are superficial tools that allow hiding your public posts from the people around you. Adding these superficial tools enables companies to calm down the public and change nothing in how they are turning over private data to marketers and other third parties.</p>
<p>At Telegram we think that the two most important components of Internet privacy should be instead:</p>
<ol>
<li>Protecting your private conversations from snooping third parties, such as officials, employers, etc.</li>
<li>Protecting your personal data from third parties, such as marketers, advertisers, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is what everybody should care about, and these are some of our top priorities. Telegram&#39;s aim is to create a truly free messenger, <a href="/privacy">without the usual caveats</a>. This means that instead of diverting public attention with low-impact settings, we can afford to focus on the real privacy issues that exist in the modern world.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-what-about-gdpr" href="#q-what-about-gdpr"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: What about GDPR?</h4>
<p>New regulations regarding data privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in Europe on May 25, 2018. Since taking back our right to privacy was the reason we made Telegram, there wasn‘t much we had to change. We don’t use your data for ad targeting, we don’t sell it to others, and we’re not part of any <del>mafia family</del> “family of companies.”</p>
<p>Telegram only keeps the information it needs to function as a feature-rich cloud service — for example, your cloud chats so that you can access them from any devices without using third-party backups, or your contacts so that you can rely on your existing social graph when messaging people on Telegram. Please see our <a href="https://telegram.org/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for more information.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://t.me/gdprbot"><strong>@GDPRbot</strong></a> to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request a copy of all your data that Telegram stores.</li>
<li>Contact us about Data Privacy.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.messenger">Android</a> users got a GDPR update with version 4.8.9 which allows more control over synced contacts and adds other privacy settings. On June, 1, Apple <a href="https://t.me/durov/88">approved</a> Telegram v.4.8.2 for iOS with these features.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-there-39s-illegal-content-on-telegram-how-do-i-take-it-down" href="#q-there-39s-illegal-content-on-telegram-how-do-i-take-it-down"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: There&#39;s illegal content on Telegram. How do I take it down?</h4>
<p>All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants. We do not process any requests related to them.</p>
<p>But <strong>sticker sets</strong>, <strong>channels</strong>, and <strong>bots</strong> on Telegram are <em>publicly available</em>. If you find sticker sets or bots on Telegram that you think are illegal, please ping us at <a href="mailto:abuse@telegram.org">abuse@telegram.org</a>.</p>
<p>You can also use the ‘report’ buttons right inside our apps, see <a href="https://t.me/isiswatch/2">this post</a> on our official <a href="https://t.me/isiswatch">@ISISwatch channel</a> for details.</p>

<p>All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants. We do not process any requests related to them. But <strong>sticker sets</strong>, <strong>channels</strong>, and <strong>bots</strong> on Telegram are <em>publicly available</em>.</p>
<p>If you see a bot, channel, or sticker set that is infringing on your copyright, kindly submit a complaint to <a href="mailto:dmca@telegram.org">dmca@telegram.org</a>. Please note that such requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-wait-0-o-do-you-process-take-down-requests-from-third-parties" href="#q-wait-0-o-do-you-process-take-down-requests-from-third-parties"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Wait! 0_o Do you process take-down requests from third parties?</h4>
<p>Our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet. To do this in the places where it is most needed (and to continue distributing Telegram through the App Store and Google Play), we have to process legitimate requests to take down illegal <strong>public</strong> content (e.g., sticker sets, bots, and channels) within the app. For example, we can take down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots.</p>
<p>User-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers are not part of the core Telegram UI. Whenever we receive a complaint at <a href="mailto:abuse@telegram.org">abuse@telegram.org</a> or <a href="mailto:dmca@telegram.org">dmca@telegram.org</a> regarding the legality of public content, we perform the necessary legal checks and take it down when deemed appropriate.</p>
<p>Please note that this does <strong>not</strong> apply to local restrictions on freedom of speech.  For example, if criticizing the government is illegal in some country, Telegram won‘t be a part of such politically motivated censorship. This goes against our founders’ <a href="https://mashable.com/2015/05/18/russias-mark-zuckerberg-pavel-durov/">principles</a>. While we do block terrorist (e.g. ISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions.</p>

<p>If you think we banned your bot, channel, or sticker set for no apparent reasons, drop us a line at <a href="mailto:abuse@telegram.org">abuse@telegram.org</a>.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-do-you-process-data-requests" href="#q-do-you-process-data-requests"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Do you process data requests?</h4>
<p><a href="#secret-chats">Secret chats</a> use end-to-end encryption, thanks to which we don&#39;t have any data to disclose.</p>
<p>To protect the data that is not covered by end-to-end encryption, Telegram uses a distributed infrastructure. Cloud chat data is stored in multiple data centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities spread across different jurisdictions. The relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect. As a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up any data.</p>
<p>Thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people&#39;s privacy and freedom of expression. Telegram can be forced to give up data only if an issue is grave and universal enough to pass the scrutiny of several different legal systems around the world.</p>
<p>To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user data to third parties, including governments.</p>

<p><em>iOS:</em> The basic invitations are simple SMS messages. They will be charged as standard outgoing SMS by your carrier (unless sent via iMessage). Naturally, you have other options to bring your friends here. Try sending them a download link via any other messaging service: email, Facebook, WhatsApp, an actual telegram — you name it. The link: <a href="https://telegram.org/dl/"><strong><a href="https://telegram.org/dl/">https://telegram.org/dl/</a></strong></a></p>
<p><em>Android:</em> Open the app menu (swipe right in chat list) — Invite Friends. Then choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.</p>
<p><em>Windows Phone:</em> Go to Contacts — Invite Friends. Then choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.</p>

<p><em>One check</em> — message delivered to the Telegram cloud and your friend has been notified if he allows notifications.<br/><em>Two checks</em> — message read (your friend opened Telegram and opened the conversation with the message).</p>
<p>We don‘t have a ’delivered to device&#39; status for messages because Telegram can run on as many devices as you want. So which particular one would that check mean?</p>

<p>You can choose who sees this info in <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/privacy-revolution">Privacy and Security</a> settings.</p>
<p>Remember that you won‘t see Last Seen timestamps for people with whom you don’t share your own. You will, however, see an approximate last seen value. This keeps stalkers away but makes it possible to understand whether a person is reachable over Telegram. There are four possible approximate values:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Last seen recently</strong> — covers anything between 1 second and 2-3 days</li>
<li><strong>Last seen within a week</strong> — between 2-3 and seven days</li>
<li><strong>Last seen within a month</strong> — between 6-7 days and a month</li>
<li><strong>Last seen a long time ago</strong> — more than a month (this is also always shown to blocked users)</li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-who-can-see-me-online" href="#q-who-can-see-me-online"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Who can see me ‘online’?</h4>
<p>The <a href="#q-can-i-hide-my-last-seen-time">last seen</a> rules apply to your online status as well. People can only see you online if you&#39;re sharing your last seen status with them.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions because sometimes it is obvious that you are online. Regardless of the last seen settings, people will see you online for a brief period (~30 seconds) if you do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send them a message in a one-on-one chat or in a group where you both are members.</li>
<li>Read a message they sent you in a one-on-one chat.</li>
<li>Broadcast a “typing…” status to their chat with you or to a group where you both are members.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you‘re not sharing your last seen timestamp with someone and don’t do anything of the above, they&#39;ll never see you online. Another way of achieving this is to block that person. </p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-can-i-delete-my-messages" href="#q-can-i-delete-my-messages"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Can I delete my messages?</h4>
<p>Yes. Previously, you could unsend your messages within 48 hours after sending them. As of <a href="/blog/unsend-privacy-emoji">Telegram 5.5</a>, you can always delete any messages you sent or received in <em>any</em> one-on-one conversation (in groups, it&#39;s still your own messages only). You can also clear the entire chat history on both ends. On Telegram, deleted messages do not leave a mark in the chat.</p>

<p>Together with privacy settings for <a href="/blog/unsend-privacy-emoji#anonymous-forwarding">forwarded messages</a>, this makes exchanging Telegram messages similar to talking face to face (without a tape recorder).

<p>Telegram groups can have up to <strong>200,000 members</strong> each and are extremely powerful communication tools. Here are a few key features that make them stand out in the messaging world: </p>
<p><strong>Unified history</strong><br/>Edit your messages after posting, delete them so that they disappear for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-platform availability</strong><br/>Access your messages anytime, from any number of your mobile or desktop devices.</p>
<p><strong>Instant search</strong><br/>Find the message you&#39;re looking for, even among millions. Filter by sender to make searching easier.</p>
<p><strong>Replies, mentions, hashtags</strong><br/>Easily trace a conversation and keep communication efficient, no matter the group size.</p>
<p><strong>Smart notifications</strong><br/>>Mute the group to get notifications only when people mention you or reply to your messages.</p>
<p><strong>Pinned messages</strong><br/>You can pin any message to be displayed at the top of the chat screen. All members will get a notification — even if they muted ordinary messages from your group.</p>
<p><strong>Moderation tools</strong><br/>Appoint administrators that can mass-delete messages, control membership, and pin important messages. Define their admin privileges with granular precision.</p>
<p><strong>Group permissions</strong><br/>Set default permissions to restrict all members from posting specific kinds of content. Or even restrict members from sending messages altogether – and let the admins chat amongst themselves while everybody else is watching.</p>
<p><strong>File sharing</strong><br/>Send and receive files of any type, up to 1,5 GB in size each, access them instantly on your other devices.</p>
<p><strong>Public groups</strong><br/>Get a <a href="#usernames-and-t-me">short link</a> for your group and make it public, like <a href="https://t.me/publictestgroup">t.me/publictestgroup</a>. This way, anybody can view the group&#39;s entire chat history and join to post messages.</p>
<p><strong>Customization via bots</strong><br/>Create custom tools for any specific needs using our <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots">Bot API</a> and <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/inline">Inline Bots</a>.</p>

<p>Telegram <strong>groups</strong> are ideal for sharing stuff with friends and family or collaboration in small teams. But groups can also grow very large and support communities of up to 200,000 members. You can make any group <strong>public</strong>, toggle <strong>persistent history</strong> to control whether or not new members have access to earlier messages and appoint <strong>administrators</strong> with granular privileges. You can also pin important messages to the top of the screen so that all members can see them, including those who have just joined.</p>
<p><strong>Channels</strong> are a tool for broadcasting messages to large audiences. In fact, a channel can have an unlimited number of subscribers. When you post in a channel, the message is signed with the channel&#39;s name and photo and not your own. Each message in a channel has a <strong>view counter</strong> that gets updated when the message is viewed, including its forwarded copies.</p>

<p>You can set up a <strong>public</strong> username on Telegram. It then becomes possible for other users to find you by that username — you will appear in contacts search under ‘global results’. Please note that people who find you will be able to send you messages, even if they don&#39;t know your number. If you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username in Telegram.</p>
<p>You can set up a username in Settings and use the universal search box in the chat list to search for chats, messages, and usernames.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve set up a username, you can give people a <a href="https://t.me/username">t.me/username</a> link. Opening that link on their phone will automatically fire up their Telegram app and open a chat with you. You can share username links with friends, write them on business cards or put them up on your website.</p>
<p>This way people can contact you on Telegram without knowing your phone number.</p>

<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-do-i-need-a-username" href="#q-do-i-need-a-username"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Do I need a username?</h4>

All data, regardless of type, is encrypted in the same way — be it text, media or files.</p>
<p>Our encryption is based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. You can find more info in the <a href="https://core.telegram.org/techfaq">Advanced FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>Telegram can help when it comes to data transfer and secure communication. This means that all data (including media and files) that you send and receive via Telegram cannot be deciphered when intercepted by your internet service provider, owners of Wi-Fi routers you connect to, or other third parties.</p>
<p>But please remember that we cannot protect you from your own mother if she takes your unlocked phone without a passcode. Or from your IT-department if they access your computer at work.

<p>Using a rooted or jailbroken device makes it easier for a potential attacker to gain full administrative control over your device — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser">root access</a>.</p>
<p>A user with root access can easily bypass security features built into the operating system, read process memory or access restricted areas, such as the <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesInternal">internal storage</a>. Once an attacker has root access, any efforts to mitigate threats become futile. No application can be called safe under these circumstances, no matter how strong the encryption.</p>

<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-are-secret-chats-different" href="#q-how-are-secret-chats-different"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How are secret chats different?</h4>
<p>Secret chats are meant for people who want more secrecy than the average fella. All messages in secret chats use end-to-end encryption. This means only you and the recipient can read those messages — nobody else can decipher them, including us here at Telegram (<a href="#q-can-telegram-protect-me-against-everything">more on this here</a>). On top of this, Messages cannot be forwarded from secret chats. And when you delete messages on your side of the conversation, the app on the other side of the secret chat will be ordered to delete them as well.</p>
<p>You can order your messages, photos, videos and files to <a href="#q-how-do-self-destructing-messages-work">self-destruct</a> in a set amount of time after they have been read or opened by the recipient. The message will then disappear from both your and your friend&#39;s devices.</p>
<p>All secret chats in Telegram are device-specific and are not part of the Telegram cloud. This means you can only access messages in a secret chat from their device of origin. They are safe for as long as your device is safe in your pocket.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-do-i-start-a-secret-chat" href="#q-how-do-i-start-a-secret-chat"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How do I start a secret chat?</h4>
<p><em>iOS:</em> Start a new message (tap the icon in the top-right corner in Messages). Then ‘New secret chat’.<br/><em>Android:</em> Swipe right to open the menu, then ‘New secret chat’.</p>
<p>Remember that Telegram secret chats are device-specific. If you start a secret chat with a friend on one of your devices, this chat will only be available on that device. If you log out, you will lose all your secret chats. You can create as many different secret chats with the same contact as you like.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-do-self-destructing-messages-work" href="#q-how-do-self-destructing-messages-work"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How do self-destructing messages work?</h4>
<p>The Self-Destruct Timer is available for <strong>all messages</strong> in Secret Chats and for <strong>media</strong> in private cloud chats.</p>
<p>To set the timer, simply tap the clock icon (in the input field on iOS, top bar on Android), and then choose the desired time limit. The clock starts ticking the moment the message is displayed on the recipient&#39;s screen (gets two green checks). As soon as the time runs out, the message disappears from <strong>both</strong> devices. We will try to send a notification if a screenshot is taken.</p>
<p>Please note that the timer in Secret Chats only applies to messages that were sent <strong>after</strong> the timer was set. It has no effect on earlier messages.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no bulletproof way of detecting screenshots on certain systems (most notably, some Android and Windows Phone devices). We will make every effort to alert you about screenshots taken in your Secret Chats, but it may still be possible to bypass such notifications and take screenshots silently.

After the secure end-to-end connection has been established, we generate a picture that visualizes the encryption key for your chat. You can then compare this image with the one your friend has — if the two images are the same, you can be sure that the secret chat is secure, and no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle attack</a> can succeed.</p>
<p>Newer versions of Telegram apps will show a larger picture along with a textual representation of the key (this is not the key itself, of course!) when both participants are using an updated app.</p>
<p>Always compare visualizations using a channel that is known to be secure — it&#39;s safest if you do this in person, in an offline meeting with the conversation partner.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-why-not-just-make-all-chats-secret" href="#q-why-not-just-make-all-chats-secret"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Why not just make all chats ‘secret’?</h4>
<p>All Telegram messages are always securely encrypted. Messages in Secret Chats use <strong>client-client</strong> encryption, while Cloud Chats use <strong>client-server/server-client</strong> encryption and are stored encrypted in the Telegram Cloud (more <a href="https://telegram.org/privacy#4-1-storing-data">here</a>). This enables your cloud messages to be both <a href="#q-do-you-process-data-requests">secure</a> and immediately accessible from any of your devices – even if you lose your device altogether.</p>
<p>The problem of restoring access to your chat history on a newly connected device (e.g. when you lose your phone) does not have an elegant solution in the end-to-end encryption paradigm. At the same time, reliable backups are an essential feature for any mass-market messenger. To solve this problem, some applications (like Whatsapp and Viber) allow <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/10/where-whatsapp-went-wrong-effs-four-biggest-security-concerns">decryptable backups</a> that put their users&#39; privacy at risk – even if they do not enable backups themselves. Other apps ignore the need for backups altogether and fade into oblivion before ever reaching a million users.</p>
<p>We opted for a third approach by offering two distinct types of chats. Telegram disables default system backups and provides all users with an integrated security-focused backup solution in the form of Cloud Chats. Meanwhile, the separate entity of Secret Chats gives you full control over the data you do not want to be stored.</p>
<p>This allows Telegram to be widely adopted in broad circles, not just by activists and dissidents, so that the simple fact of using Telegram does not mark users as targets for heightened surveillance in certain countries. We are convinced that the separation of conversations into Cloud and Secret chats represents the most secure solution currently possible for a massively popular messaging application.</p>

<p>On Telegram, you can send messages in private chats and groups without making your phone number visible. By default, your number is only visible to people who you&#39;ve added to your address book as contacts. You can further modify this in <em>Settings &gt; Privacy and Security &gt; Phone Number</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that people will always see your number if they know it already and <strong>saved</strong> it in their address book.</p>

<p>Each phone number is a <strong>separate</strong> account on Telegram. You have several options if you are using multiple phone numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you will <strong>no longer use the old number</strong> (e.g., you moved to a new country or changed your number for good), simply go to Settings and <a href="#q-how-do-i-change-my-phone-number">change the number</a> connected to your Telegram account to the new number. <strong>Important:</strong> make sure you have access to your connected phone number – otherwise you risk losing access to your account.</li>
<li>If you will use the new number for a <strong>limited time</strong> (e.g., you‘re on a trip or vacation), there’s no need to do anything.</li>
<li>If you want to keep using <strong>both numbers</strong> (e.g., you have a work phone and personal phone), choose one as your Telegram number. You <em>may</em> create another Telegram account on the second number as well, for example, if you want to keep work and personal chats separated. It is possible to log in to one Telegram app with up to <strong>4</strong> different <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/autoplay#multiple-account-support">accounts</a> at once.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-do-i-log-out" href="#q-how-do-i-log-out"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How do I log out?</h4>
<p>Most users don&#39;t need to log out of Telegram:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use Telegram on many devices <strong>at the same time</strong>. Just use the same phone number to log in on all devices.</li>
<li>You can go to <em>Settings &gt; Data and Storage &gt; Storage Usage&gt; Clear cache</em> to <strong>free up space</strong> on your device without logging out.</li>
<li>If you use Telegram with <strong>multiple phone numbers</strong>, you can <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/themes-accounts#multiple-accounts">switch between accounts</a> without logging out.</li>
<li>If you use Telegram on a <strong>shared device</strong>, you can set up a passcode in <em>Settings &gt; Privacy and Security</em> to make sure only you have access to your account.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do want to log out for some reason, here&#39;s how you do that:</p>
<p><em>iOS</em>: Go to Settings — Edit — Log out.<br/><em>Android</em>, <em>Telegram Desktop</em>: Go to Settings — … (in the top right corner) — Log out.</p>
<p>If you log out, you will keep all your cloud messages. However, you <strong>will lose</strong> all your <strong>Secret Chats</strong> and <strong>all messages</strong> inside those secret chats when you log out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that logging out does <strong>not</strong> trigger remote deletion of your secret chat messages on your partner‘s device — to do that, choose ’Clear History&#39; first.</p>

<p>You can change your number in Telegram and keep <strong>everything</strong>, including all your contacts, messages, and media from the Telegram cloud, as well as all your Secret Chats on all devices.</p>
<p>To change your number, go to Settings, then tap on your phone number (just above the username), then ‘Change Number’. If you already have a different Telegram account on the target number, you&#39;ll need to <a href="#q-how-do-i-delete-my-account">delete</a> that account first.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-do-i-delete-my-account" href="#q-how-do-i-delete-my-account"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How do I delete my account?</h4>
<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the <a href="https://telegram.org/deactivate">deactivation page</a>. Deleting your account permanently removes all your <strong>messages</strong> and <strong>contacts</strong>. All groups and channels that you&#39;ve created are orphaned and left without a creator but admins retain their rights.</p>
<p>This action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.</p>

<p>As was just mentioned above, all your data will be flushed from our system: all messages, groups, and contacts associated with your account will be deleted. That said, your contacts will still be able to chat in the groups that you have created, and they will still have <em>their</em> copy of the messages you sent them. So if you want to send messages that can vanish without a trace, try using our <a href="#q-how-do-self-destructing-messages-work">self-destruct timer</a> instead.</p>
<p>Termination of a Telegram account is irreversible. If you sign up again, you will appear as a new user and will not get your history, contacts or groups back. People, who have your phone number in their contacts, will be notified. The new user will be displayed as a separate conversation in their messages list and their conversation history with this new user will be empty.</p>

If you stop using Telegram and don&#39;t come online for at least six months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud. You can change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct in Settings.</p>

<p>First of all, sorry about your phone. Unfortunately, the phone number is the only way for us to identify a Telegram user at the moment. We don‘t collect additional information about you, so whoever has the number, has the account.

<p>Common thieves usually throw out the SIM card immediately (the phone is harder to locate this way), then wipe the devices and sell them, so there isn&#39;t much risk for the data in case of regular petty theft. But if you have reasons to worry about the data on the device and are unable to <a href="#i-have-access-to-telegram-on-another-device">log out the other device</a>, it is best that you wipe it remotely. You can read more about it here: <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH2701">Apple iOS</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/android/devicemanager">Android</a>. Unfortunately, this requires you to have prepared in advance for this scenario.</p>
<p>You can <a href="#q-how-do-i-delete-my-account">delete your Telegram account</a> if you are logged in on at least one of your other devices (mobile or desktop). Note that inactive Telegram accounts self-destruct automatically after a period of time — 6 months being the default setting.</p>

<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-what-are-bots" href="#q-what-are-bots"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: What are bots?</h4>
<p>Bots are like small programs that run right inside Telegram. They are made by third-party developers using the <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots">Telegram Bot API</a>.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-how-do-i-create-a-bot" href="#q-how-do-i-create-a-bot"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: How do I create a bot?</h4>
<p>Creating Telegram bots is super-easy, but you will need at least some skills in computer programming. If you‘re sure you’re up to it, our <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots"><strong>Introduction for Developers</strong></a> is a good place to start.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no out-of-the-box ways to create a working bot if you are not a developer. But we‘re sure you’ll soon find plenty of bots created by other people to play with.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-a-bot-is-sending-me-messages-how-do-i-make-it-stop" href="#q-a-bot-is-sending-me-messages-how-do-i-make-it-stop"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: A bot is sending me messages, how do I make it stop?</h4>
<p>If you don‘t want a bot to send you messages, feel free to block it – same as you would block a human user. Some Telegram clients have a ’Stop Bot‘ button right in the bot’s profile.</p>
<p>That said, most bot developers offer commands that silence the bot, check its <em>/help</em> for clues.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-are-bots-safe" href="#q-are-bots-safe"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Are bots safe?</h4>
<p>Yes. Bots are no different from human users that you meet in groups for example. They can see your public name, username, and profile pictures, and they can see messages you send to them, that‘s it. They can’t access your last seen status and <strong>don&#39;t</strong> see your phone number (unless you decide to give it to them yourself).</p>
<p>Naturally, any bot should be treated as a stranger — don&#39;t give them your passwords, Telegram codes or bank account numbers, even if they ask nicely. Also, be careful when opening files sent by bots, same as you would deal with ordinary humans. Example: If a bot sent us a file called <em>OpenMe.exe</em>, we probably wouldn&#39;t open it.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-if-i-add-a-bot-to-my-group-can-it-read-my-messages" href="#q-if-i-add-a-bot-to-my-group-can-it-read-my-messages"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: If I add a bot to my group, can it read my messages?</h4>
<p>Bots can work in two modes when you add them to groups. By default, bots only see messages that are meant for them. In this case, you‘ll see ’has no access to messages&#39; in the group members list next to the bot.</p>
<p>Some bots need more information to work, so developers may disable the privacy mode. In this case, the bot will see all messages sent to the group, and you will see ‘has access to messages’ in the members list next to the bot.</p>
<p><a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode">Learn more about privacy mode for bots »</a></p>
<p>If your group contains very sensitive information, maybe it‘s better to avoid adding bots you don’t trust 100%.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="q-are-bots-made-by-telegram" href="#q-are-bots-made-by-telegram"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Q: Are bots made by Telegram?</h4>
<p>No. While we have some official bots for specific purposes (like <a href="https://t.me/gif">@gif</a> or <a href="https://t.me/gdprbot">@GDPRbot</a>), we don&#39;t usually make bots.

<h4><a class="anchor" name="deleting-contacts-on-android" href="#deleting-contacts-on-android"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Deleting contacts on Android</h4>
<p>To delete a contact, open a chat with the person, tap on their profile photo in the top area of the chat screen, then tap on ‘…’ in the top right corner — ‘Delete’.</p>
<p>If you want to delete the contact completely, make sure you also delete them from your phone contacts. Telegram stays in sync and will add the contact back if you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Secret Chats are established between the two devices they were created on. This means that all those messages are not available in the cloud and cannot be accessed on other devices.</p>
<p>Moreover, Secret Chats are also tied to your current login session on the device. If you log out and in again, you will lose all your Secret Chats.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="can-39t-send-messages-to-non-contacts" href="#can-39t-send-messages-to-non-contacts"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Can&#39;t send messages to non-contacts</h4>
<p>When users report unwanted messages from a Telegram account, we apply a limit: Reported accounts can only send messages to people who have their number saved as a contact.</p>
<p>This means that if you randomly contact people you don&#39;t know and send them annoying messages, you may lose the ability to do so in the future.</p>
<p>If you think that this limit was applied to your account wrongly, please visit <a href="/faq_spam">this page</a>.</p>
